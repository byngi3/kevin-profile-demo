            >kevin is a crazy 12-year-old with an infectious sense of humor. He's always up to something funny, keeping everyone around him laughing with his wild ideas and playful antics. Whether he's cracking jokes or coming up with the silliest pranks, he knows how to brighten up any day. Sure, he might act a little foolish sometimes, but that's what makes him so entertaining and lovable. His energy and creativity make every moment spent with him unforgettable!"(and also one of the best kurip i have ever seen in my life and also known as kunjappan.)
